### Naming Error 
- Create a new variable then change / misspell the variable name : Code 13 to 14 , thus creating the Name Error ... 
- Or when one forget to set the variable value thus it becomes an empty variable .

# DATA TYPES 

## Strings 
- This is a series of characters thus anything inside single and double quotes is considered to be a string in Python . Code 27 to 29 

### Changing cases of words in a string using methods 
- Changing case : Using ... .title() thus capitalizes the first letter of the desired values . Code 38 to 39  .
- Method : This is an action that Python perform on a piece of data .

### Using variables inside of strings 
- Through the f-string method . Code 45 to 50 .
- NB : The f ought to be outside the quotes marks .
- Using the format() method . Code 52 . Code 54 to 57 .

### whitespaces 
- This include new lines , tabs and end of line symbols or simply none printing characters .
- Code 61 : \t adds a tab to the output thus spacing ot making it easier to read .
- Adding newlines with character combinations \n .Code 62 .
- NB : U can also combine them the \t and \n .

### Stripping white space 
- 'python' and ' python ' are 2 very different things .
- This comes in handy when login of user names that checking for extra 'non essential' whitespaces .
